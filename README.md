# zynq_sm_dma
Simple DMA channel for Zynq-7000

## Overview

This project is simple DMA channel for small Zynq devices. Main goal is compact code for Zynq Z010, Z020.

Main features:
* Main languege is VHDL, top level of project is VHDL
* Direct connect for Zynq AXI3 buses without interconnect
* Simulation in pure VHDL without AXI BFM from Xilinx
* Zynq is located in single BD

Boards:
* Microzed

Simulation:
 * Active-HDL 9.3
 * Vivado 2018.2
